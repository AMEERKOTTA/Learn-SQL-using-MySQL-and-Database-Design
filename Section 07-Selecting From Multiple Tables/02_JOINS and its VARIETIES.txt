To Join two tables there should be a related column between the tables.

There are different kind of Joins.

INNER JOIN : This will Retrieve data only when there is matching values in both tables.

LEFT JOIN : This will retrieve all data from the left table (table1) and matching rows from the right table (table2).

RIGHT JOIN : This will retrieve all data from the right table (table2) and matching rows from the left table (table1).
