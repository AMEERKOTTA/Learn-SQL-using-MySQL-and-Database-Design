## I want to do a INNER JOIN.
## to fetch the name of the Products from product table.
## and Ordertime from the Order Table.

SELECT products.Name, orders.OrderTime FROM orders
INNER JOIN products
ON orders.ProductId = products.Id;

## short form method
SELECT p.Name, o.OrderTime FROM
orders o JOIN products p
ON o.ProductId = p.Id;

## adding price column as well.
## then order by using the OrderTime column.
SELECT p.Name, o.OrderTime, p.Price FROM
orders o JOIN products p
ON o.ProductId = p.Id
ORDER BY o.OrderTime;

## giving a where condition as well.
SELECT p.Name, o.OrderTime, p.Price FROM
orders o JOIN products p
ON o.ProductId = p.Id
WHERE o.ProductId = 5
ORDER BY o.OrderTime;


============================================================
This is incomplete.
## another query using orders table and customers table.
SELECT * FROM orders;
SELECT * FROM customers;
# o - orders table
# c - customers table
SELECT c.FirstName, c.SecondName, o.ProdcutId, o.OrderTime
FROM orders o JOIN customers c
ON o.ProductId = c.;
